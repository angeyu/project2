## Usage

### Today, have you:

* taken your medication or vitamins?
* hugged or talked to a friend?
* eaten your meals?
* exercised or moved around?
* meditated or prayed?
* kept up with a hobby?

### User Story
* As a human being interested in wellness and general happiness,
* I want to log my progress in seven self-care areas: hydration, medication intake, close friend contact, food intake, movement, spiritual practice (meditation or prayer), and hobbies, 
* So that I can track my general health and wellness on a daily basis and make sure I'm doing my best to live a good life!
