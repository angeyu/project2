## Usage

### Have you:

* had water today?

* taken your medication or vitamins?

* hugged or talked to a friend?

* eaten your meals?

* exercised or moved around?

* meditated or prayed?

* kept up with a hobby?

### User Story

* As a human being interested in wellness and general happiness,

* I want to log my progress in seven self-care areas: hydration, medication intake, close friend contact, food intake, movement, spiritual practice (meditation or prayer), and hobbies, 

* So that I can track my general health and wellness on a daily basis and make sure I'm doing my best to live a good life!
